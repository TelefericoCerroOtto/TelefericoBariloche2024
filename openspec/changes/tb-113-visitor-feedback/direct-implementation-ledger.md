# TB-113 Direct Implementation Ledger

This append-only ledger bridges direct implementation work to possible later formal SDD closure. It is not canonical `apply-progress`, a `verify-report`, native attempt state, receipt evidence, or review authority.

## Recording rules

- Append one entry per work unit. Do not rewrite earlier evidence; append a dated correction when a fact changes.
- Record only observed evidence. Never infer a pass from implementation, review, a merge, another check, or an earlier result.
- Use honest status values: `pending`, `passed`, `failed`, or `not run`.
- Keep exact commands, scenarios, results, revision identifiers, pull request links, and merge evidence when they exist.
- Assign every deferred validation to an intended future checkpoint and owner.
- Tie every later failure and correction back to the originating work unit.
- Leave formal task completion checkboxes and verify or archive claims pending until formal evidence is actually executed and admitted.
- Do not treat this ledger as retroactive native SDD receipts or authority.

**Stop condition:** If a result was not observed, record `not run` or `pending`; do not record `passed`.

## Work unit entry template

Copy this section for each completed or in-progress work unit. Replace every angle-bracket placeholder with observed information or an explicit `pending` or `not run` value. The template itself is not work-unit evidence.

### `<work-unit-id>: <work-unit-name>`

- **Identity and scope:** `<bounded outcome and explicit exclusions>`
- **Requirements references:** `<proposal or specification anchors>`
- **Design references:** `<design anchors>`
- **Task references:** `<task identifiers>`
- **Dependencies:** `<required predecessor units, services, approvals, or none>`
- **Changed paths and reasons:**
  - `<path>` — `<reason>`
- **Implementation:**
  - Status: `<pending|passed|failed|not run>`
  - Revision: `<commit SHA or pending>`
  - Pull request: `<URL or pending>`
  - Merge evidence: `<merge commit or pending>`
- **Focused tests:**
  - Command: `<exact command>`
  - Status: `<pending|passed|failed|not run>`
  - Exact result: `<exit status and concise observed output, or not run>`
- **Intentionally deferred validation:**
  - Exact command or scenario: `<exact command or scenario>`
  - Status: `not run`
  - Reason: `<why validation is deferred>`
  - Intended future checkpoint: `<implementation PR CI, integrated human validation on development, promotion CI, formal verification, or other>`
  - Owner: `<responsible role, team, or person>`
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - `<criterion and current status: pending|passed|failed|not run>`
- **Residual risks:** `<known risks or none observed>`
- **Rollback boundary:** `<smallest safe revert or disable boundary>`
- **Later integrated validation:**
  - Status: `<pending|passed|failed|not run>`
  - Evidence: `<exact command, scenario, revision, result, and date, or pending>`
- **Correction or follow-up:**
  - Trigger: `<later failed check or validation evidence, or none>`
  - Status: `<pending|passed|failed|not run>`
  - Fix evidence: `<linked revision, pull request, changed paths, and reason, or pending>`
  - Revalidation evidence: `<exact command or scenario and observed result, or pending>`
- **Formal SDD reconstruction:**
  - Status: `<pending|passed|failed|not run>`
  - Evidence: `<fresh formal verification or archive evidence, or pending>`

When a work unit has multiple focused or deferred checks, repeat the corresponding command or scenario block. Do not collapse distinct results into one inferred status.
